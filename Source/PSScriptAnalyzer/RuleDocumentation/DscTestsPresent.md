#DscTestsPresent
**Severity Level: Information**


##Description

Checks that DSC tests for given resource are present.

##How to Fix

To fix a violation of this rule, please make sure Tests directory is present:
* For non-class based resources it should exist at the same folder level as DSCResources folder.
* For class based resources it should be present at the same folder level as resource psm1 file. 

Tests folder should contain test script for given resource - file name should contain resource's name.

##Example

### Non-class based resource

Let's assume we have non-class based resource with a following file structure:

* xAzure
  * DSCResources
    * MSFT_xAzureSubscription
      * MSFT_xAzureSubscription.psm1
      * MSFT_xAzureSubscription.schema.mof

In this case, to fix this warning, we should add tests in a following way:

* xAzure
  * DSCResources
    * MSFT_xAzureSubscription
      * MSFT_xAzureSubscription.psm1
      * MSFT_xAzureSubscription.schema.mof
  * Tests
    * MSFT_xAzureSubscription_Tests.ps1

### Class based resource

Let's assume we have class based resource with a following file structure:

* MyDscResource
    * MyDscResource.psm1
    * MyDscresource.psd1

In this case, to fix this warning, we should add tests in a following way:

* MyDscResource
    * MyDscResource.psm1
    * MyDscresource.psd1
    * Tests
      * MyDscResource_Tests.ps1
