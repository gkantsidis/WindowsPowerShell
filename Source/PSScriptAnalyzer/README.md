=============


Introduction
============

PSScriptAnalyzer is a static code checker for Windows PowerShell modules and scripts. PSScriptAnalyzer checks the quality of Windows PowerShell code by running a set of rules. The rules are based on PowerShell best practices identified by PowerShell Team and the community. It generates DiagnosticResults (errors and warnings) to inform users about potential code defects and suggests possible solutions for improvements.

PSScriptAnalyzer is shipped with a collection of built-in rules that checks various aspects of PowerShell code such as presence of uninitialized variables, usage of PSCredential Type, usage of Invoke-Expression etc. Additional functionalities such as exclude/include specific rules are also supported.

PSScriptAnalyzer cmdlets
======================
```
Get-ScriptAnalyzerRule [-CustomizedRulePath <string[]>] [-Name <string[]>] [<CommonParameters>] [-Severity <string[]>]

Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer [-Path] <string> [-CustomizedRulePath <string[]>] [-ExcludeRule <string[]>] [-IncludeRule <string[]>] [-Severity <string[]>] [-Recurse] [<CommonParameters>]
```

Requirements
============

WS2012R2 / Windows 8.1 / Windows OS running **PowerShell v5.0** and **Windows Management Framework 5.0 Preview**

Download the latest WMF package from [Windows Management Framework 5.0 Preview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=398175).

Installation
============

1. Build the Code using Visual Studio [solution part of the repo] and navigate to the binplace location [``~/ProjectRoot/PSScriptAnalyzer``]

2. In PowerShell Console:
```powershell
Import-Module PSScriptAnalyzer
```
If you have previous version of PSScriptAnalyzer installed on your machine, you may need to override old binaries by copying content of [``~/ProjectRoot/PSScriptAnalyzer``] to PSModulePath. 

To confirm installation: run ```Get-ScriptAnalyzerRule``` in the PowerShell console to obtain the built-in rules

Suppressing Rules
=================

You can suppress a rule by decorating a script/function or script/function parameter with .NET's [SuppressMessageAttribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.codeanalysis.suppressmessageattribute.aspx).  `SuppressMessageAttribute`'s constructor takes two parameters: a category and a check ID. Set the `categoryID` parameter to the name of the rule you want to suppress (you may omit the `checkID` parameter):

    function SuppressMe()
    {
        [Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSProvideCommentHelp")]
        param()

        Write-Verbose -Message "I'm making a difference!"
        
    }
    
All rule violations within the scope of the script/function/parameter you decorate will be suppressed.
    
To suppress a message on a specific parameter, set the `SuppressMessageAttribute`'s `CheckId` parameter to the name of the parameter:

    function SuppressTwoVariables()
    {
        [Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSProvideDefaultParameterValue", "b")]
        [Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSProvideDefaultParameterValue", "a")]
        param([string]$a, [int]$b)
        {
        }
    }

Use the `SuppressMessageAttribute`'s `Scope` property to limit rule suppression to functions or classes within the attribute's scope. Use the value `Function` to suppress violations on all functions within the attribute's scope. Use the value `Class` to suppress violoations on all classes within the attribute's scope:


    [Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSProvideCommentHelp", "", Scope="Function")]
    param(
    )
    
    function InternalFunction
    {
        param()
        
        Write-Verbose -Message "I am invincible!"
    }
    
The above example demonstrates how to suppress rule violations for internal functions using the `SuppressMessageAttribute`'s `Scope` property.

You can further restrict suppression based on a function/parameter/class/variable/object's name by setting the `SuppressMessageAttribute's` `Target` property to a regular expression. Any function/parameter/class/variable/object whose name matches the regular expression is skipped.

    [Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSAvoidUsingPositionalParameters", Scope="Function", Target="PositionalParametersAllowed")]
    Param(
    )
     
    function PositionalParametersAllowed()
    {
        Param([string]$Parameter1)
        {
            Write-Verbose $Parameter1
        }
    
    }
    
    function PositionalParametersNotAllowed()
    {
        param([string]$Parameter1)
        {
            Write-Verbose $Parameter1
        }
    }
    
    # The script analyzer will skip this violation
    PositionalParametersAllowed 'value1'
    
    # The script analyzer will report this violation
    PositionalParametersNotAllowed 'value1
    
To match all functions/variables/parameters/objects, use `*` as the value of the Target parameter:

    [Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSAvoidUsingPositionalParameters", Scope="Function", Target="*")]
    Param(
    )




Building the Code
=================

Use Visual Studio to build "PSScriptAnalyzer.sln". Use ~/PSScriptAnalyzer/ folder to load PSScriptAnalyzer.psd1

**Note: If there are any build errors, please refer to Requirements section and make sure all dependencies are properly installed**


Running Tests
=============

Pester-based ScriptAnalyzer Tests are located in ```<branch>/PSScriptAnalyzer/Tests``` folder

* Ensure Pester is installed on the machine
* Go the Tests folder in your local repository
* Run Engine Tests:
.\InvokeScriptAnalyzer.tests.ps1
* Run Tests for Built-in rules:
.\*.ps1 (Example - .\ AvoidConvertToSecureStringWithPlainText.ps1)
*You can also run all tests under \Engine or \Rules by calling Invoke-Pester in the Engine/Rules directory.
